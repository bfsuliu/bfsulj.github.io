            <h1>Charles Paxton Zaner (1864–1918)</h1>
            <p>Charles Paxton Zaner was an American calligrapher, pen artist, and teacher of penmanship.
                Zaner was born near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. 
                He attended G. W. Michael's Pen Art Hall course in penmanship in Oberlin, Ohio, in 1882. 
                By 1888, Zaner had been a teacher of penmanship at two Ohio colleges, and after the second had closed, he decided to open his own college where he could teach the art. 
                Zaner's school was originally known as Zanerian Art College and was a joint venture with Lloyd Kelchner. 
                In 1891, Zaner sold Elmer W. Bloser a share of the school. 
                Kelchner left before the end of the year, resulting with Zaner and Bloser becoming equal partners. 
                This company eventually became what is now the Zaner-Bloser Company and operated the Zanerian College of Penmanship in Columbus, Ohio.
                Zaner died on the evening of December 1, 1918, in Mifflin, Ohio, when the car in which he was riding was struck by an oncoming train.

            <br>
            <h3>Movement and Form</h3>
            <p>Zaner examined the idea of movement creating the form of letters written in the cursive hand using the muscular arm method, prevalent in the United States from the late 19th century (e.g. Palmer Method). 
                He considered the hinge action of the forearm as the central energy of movement and that its relation to the direction of writing, or page angle, could affect letter form and the effort required. 
                By changing from a page angle which placed letter down strokes on a line towards the center of the body, as other educators advised, Zaner offered a means to link muscle effort with balanced (medium), condensed (compact style), or extended (running hand) letter forms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Hand Action</h3>
            <p>In handwriting courses such as the Palmer Method the fingers used to support and steady the hand on the page for arm movement were fixed in relation to the pen, for example, “the nails of the third and fourth fingers should rest lightly on the paper, and should follow the course of the pen in every direction”.
                <br><br>Zaner's lessons in business and ornamental penmanship attempted to describe how professional writers of these styles used the 'rest' fingers to control movement. 
                For writing lower case letters, Zaner explained the technique of letting the little finger slide to right in making up strokes, but to rest or drag for down strokes in order to improve control of the arm movement. 
                This required the joints of the rest fingers to act on the down strokes, independent of those holding the pen, which Zaner termed as <i>hand action</i>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Professional Pen Work</h3>
            <p>In the field of professional penmanship as a fine art, Zaner produced educational material and instruction, going beyond the copybook as in his lessons for school and commercial handwriting. 
                His capital letters for Ornamental Penmanship appearing with comments by Earl A. Lupfer in <i>The Educator</i> showed how basic forms could be extended by flourishes with "balance, symmetry, and grace".

            <h1>Willis A. Baird (1882-1954)</h1>
            <p>Willis A. Baird achieved a skill in engraver's script that was second to none and equal to his teacher, Charlton V Howe. In this form of writing, both Baird and Howe gained reputations as excelling above all other penmen. 
            Baird was born in Santa Cruz, California on November 14, 1882. 
            He spent a summer at the Zanerian College, Columbus, Ohio in 1909, where he studied engrossing and a variety of penmanship styles under the great master penman, C. P. Zaner. 
            Later that year he met William E. Dennis and worked for him, penning diplomas and other artwork as the job required. 
            His skill at engrossing was of an exceptional level, and in 1914 he became a partner of Dennis. 
            The Dennis and Baird Studio, located at 357 Fulton Street, Brooklyn, New York, became one of the most highly respected firms of its kind in the nation. 
            Willis A. Baird died in Brooklyn, New York, on August 10, 1954, age 72 years.
           </p><br>
           <h3>The Obituary Notice for Willis A. Baird Taken from The Educator, 1955</h3>
           <p>It is with saddened hearts and a realization of an irreparable loss that we learned of the recent death of our friend, Willis A. Baird, the master engrosser and illuminator of Brooklyn, New York. 
               He died August 10, 1954. <br><br>
               We met him for the first time in 1907 when he enrolled in the Zanerian College, where we studied and worked together. 
               He was a leader among the boys who admired him for his ability and fine character. 
               It was an inspiration to watch him work. <br><br>
               Few men have had the training and close association with leading engrossers and illuminators of the entire profession. 
               Mr. Baird's Engrosser's Script writing, early in his career, reached a degree of perfection and beauty equaled by no other penman - he was the king of scriptwriters.<br><br>
               As an all-round engrosser and illuminator, his masterful, accurate work earned for him a position ranking with the work of the all time great masters.<br><br>
               From the Zanerian, Mr. Baird went to New York City to work as an engrosser. 
               His work attracted the attention of that lovable and great penman and engrosser, W. E. Dennis, who persuaded him to join the Dennis Studio. 
               The result was the development of the Dennis and Baird Studio and a long and close friendship. 
               After Mr. Dennis' death, Mr. Baird continued the studio that grew in fame.<br><br>
               Willis A. Baird, above all, was a gentleman, always willing to help others. 
               The profession has suffered a tremendous loss but his work will live on to influence future generations.<br><br>
