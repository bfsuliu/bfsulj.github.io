        <h1>Origins of Writing</h1>
        <p>The earliest example of systematic writing is the Sumerian pictographic system found on clay tablets, which eventually developed around 3200 BC into a modified version called cuneiform which was impressed on wet clay with a sharpened reed. 
            This form of writing eventually evolved into an ideographic system (where a sign represents an idea) and then to a syllabic system (where a sign represents a syllable).
            Developing around the same time, the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics also began as a pictographic script and evolved into a system of syllabic writing. 
            Two cursive scripts were eventually created, hieratic, shortly after hieroglyphs were invented, and demotic (Egyptian) in the seventh century BC.
            Scribes wrote these scripts usually on papyrus, with ink on a reed pen.        
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first known alphabetical system came from the Phoenicians, who developed a vowel-less system of 22 letters around the eleventh century BC.
            The Greeks eventually adapted the Phoenician alphabet around the eighth century BC. 
            Adding vowels to the alphabet, dropping some consonants and altering the order, the Ancient Greeks developed a script which included only what we know of as capital Greek letters. 
            The lowercase letters of Classical Greek were a later invention of the Middle Ages. 
            The Phoenician alphabet also influenced the Hebrew and Aramaic scripts, which follow a vowel-less system. 
            One Hebrew script was only used for religious literature and by a small community of Samaritans up until the sixth century BC. 
            Aramaic was the official script of the Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian empires and ‘Square Hebrew’ (the script now used in Israel) developed from Aramaic around the third century AD.

        <h1>Books Used in North Amercia</h1>
        <p>
            Platt Rogers Spencer is known as the "Father of American Penmanship". 
            His writing system was first published in 1848, in his book <i>Spencer and Rice's System of Business and Ladies' Penmanship</i>. 
            The most popular Spencerian manual was <i>The Spencerian Key to Practical Penmanship</i>, published by his sons in 1866. 
            This "Spencerian Method" Ornamental Style was taught in American schools until the mid-1920s, and has seen a resurgence in recent years through charter schools and home schooling using revised Spencerian books and methods produced by former IAMPETH president Michael Sull (born 1946).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            George A. Gaskell (1845–1886), a student of Spencer, authored two popular books on penmanship, <i>Gaskell's Complete Compendium of Elegant Writing</i> and <i>The Penman's Hand-Book</i> (1883). 
            Louis Henry Hausam published the "New Education in Penmanship" in 1908, called "the greatest work of the kind ever published."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Many copybooks were produced in North America at the start of the 20th century, mostly for Business Style penmanship (a simplified form of Ornamental Style). 
            These included those produced by A. N. Palmer, a student of Gaskell, who developed the Palmer Method, as reflected in his <i>Palmer's Guide to Business Writing</i>, published in 1894. 
            Also popular was Zaner-Bloser Script, introduced by Charles Paxton Zaner (15 February 1864 – 1 December 1918) and Elmer Ward Bloser (6 November 1865 – 1929) of the Zanerian Business College. 
            The A. N. Palmer Company folded in the early 1980s.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Modern Styles include more than 200 published textbook curricula including: D'Nealian Script (a derivative of the Palmer Method which uses a slanted, serifed manuscript form followed by an entirely joined and looped cursive), Modern Zaner-Bloser which accounts for the majority of handwriting textbook sales in the US, A Beka, Schaffer, Peterson, Loops and Groups, McDougal, Steck Vaughn, and many others.
            Italic Styles include Getty-Dubay (slightly slanted), Eager, Portland, Barchowsky, Queensland, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Other copybook styles that are unique and do not fall into any previous categories are Smithhand, Handwriting without Tears, Ausgangsschrift, Bob Jones, etc. these may differ greatly from each other in a variety of ways. 
            The first made video for correcting messy handwriting especially for people with ADHD and or dysgraphia was " Anyone Can Improve Their Own Handwriting" by learning specialist Jason Mark Alster MS.c.
